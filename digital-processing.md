Digital Processing
==================

The Bentley Historical Library's digital processing procedures reflect not only our general policies and traditional archival functions of appraisal, arrangement and description, but also encompass additional procedures that ensure the authenticity, integrity and security of content.

In this context, "digital processing" corresponds to the **Generate AIP** function of the [Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model](http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf)â€™s Ingest entity. After its association with an existing accession record and its initial transfer into Archivematica, digital processing permits archivists to establish the integrity of materials, assume intellectual control over them and perform preservation events (e.g., scans for viruses and personally identifiable information, conversion to preservation formats, recording of descriptive and technical metadata, etc.) on them. This transforms the **Submission Information Package (SIP)** into an **Archival Information Package (AIP)**, which is then deposited in the Deep Blue institutional repository where portions of it usually double as a **Dissemination Information Package (DIP)**. In some cases (namely very large audio, video, or image files), anh additional DIP will be created to make it easier for patrons to download and access materials.
